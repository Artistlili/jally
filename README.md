## What is it?
VaporMIC. An application that allows users to record audio and talk to a chatbot for ideas.

A twist though, the audio doesnâ€™t save and the chatbot talks to you in symbols. The start is stop and stop is start. There is a bar that displays the sound frequencies too.

We used typescript, javascript, html and CSS.
